# Mentor.me Web Application

Website for 'Mentor.me', a teach-and-learn portal where users seeking to learn new skills can find people nearby, in their community, to arrange a meeting for an in-person class.

Anyone skilled in their particular field of expertise can create an account at Mentor.me and add a new Class. Interested users will be able to express their interest and also exchange contact details.

Website built using React ([create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)), Redux, react-router, [ant.design](https://ant.design/), Firebase (Authentication, Real-time Database and Storage).

**Note**: This is still a work-in-progress. Basic features such as Authentication, adding and viewing classses has been added. Still a long way to go :).
